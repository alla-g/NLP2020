Finally, drinks are served, and Simon drinks his beer as though it's the most delicious thing he's had in his entire life. We talk about the most random things, from the new lead he has in his case about lead poisoning to that god-awful seminar he is going to lead in two weeks. We end up discussing the works of a modern Nauruan artist whose name I don't even hope to remember, and after another round of drinks (tequila this time) I tell Simon about a guy that works in the office next door and has the most round face imagineable. Around midnight there is no more room for anything liquid in our stomachs and no cash in our wallets, so we decide to head out. Simon's car is parked around the corner and at this point he wants nothing more than to get in it and sleep it off for the next two weeks, but I point towards a cab waiting on the other side of the road, make Simon turn around and practically drag him across the street.
